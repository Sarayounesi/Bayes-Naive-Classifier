# Bayes-Naive-Classifier

Below is an overview of the problems addressed and their solutions:

1. Bayesian Classifier Implementation:
•  Problem: Implement a Bayesian classifier using the Iris dataset. Randomly shuffle the data, use 80% for training and 20% for evaluation, and report the overall accuracy as well as the accuracy for each class.

•  Solution:

•  Part 1: Train the model using the raw data and report the results.

•  Part 2: Apply various data transformations to improve the model's performance, documenting each step and its impact on the results.

•  Part 3: Compare the results of your implementation with those obtained using scikit-learn's built-in functions.

2. Theoretical Questions:
•  Question 1: Research Logistic Regression and explain its differences from Linear Regression.

•  Question 2: Given a set of documents belonging to two classes (j or c), train a Naive Bayes classifier using the training data and determine the class of a test document. Use Laplacian Smoothing with a parameter of 1, and document all steps without actual implementation.
